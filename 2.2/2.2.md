# User Login and log off

## Basic introduction:
- **Do not always use _root_ to log in the Linux system.**
  - To avoid error in operation
  - Anyway, you are able to switch to root in anytime by using:

```Linux
su- username
```
- **At command center, enter _log out_ to log out**

## Details
- **_log out_ is useless in _graphic run lever_**
