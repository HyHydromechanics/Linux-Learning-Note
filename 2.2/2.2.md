# User Login and log off

## Basic introduction:
- **Do not always use _root_ to log in the Linux system.**
  - To avoid error in operation
  - Anyway, you are able to switch to root in anytime by using:

```Linux
su- username
```
- **At command center, enter _log out_ to log out**

## Details
- **_log out_ is useless in _graphic run lever_**

# User management
> [!TIP]
> Linux system is a muti-user and muti-task system, for anyuser who want to use the system resources, you have to apply a account to the system manager, then use the account to log in the system

## How to add a user?

```Linux
user add username
```

#### Example:
> Add a user "Jelly"
```Linux
useradd Jelly
```
More detailed:
```Linux
adduser -D [-g default group] [ -b default_home] [ -f default_inactive] [ -e default_expire_date] [ -s default_ shell]
```
- **When the user is created, a file directory with the same name as the user will be created automatically**
  - You can also use _useradd -d_ to give _Jelly_ a specific place for him
```Linux
user add -d /home/Jelly Jelly
```

## How to change/give a password?

**Basic grammar**
```Linux
passwd username
```
#### Example:
> Create a user "Jelly", and give him a password

```Linux
useradd -m Jelly
passwd Jelly
```

## How to delete a user?

```Linux
userdel user name   # the folder still exists
```

#### Example:

>Delete _Jelly_ with his folder

```Linux
userdel -r Jelly
```

## How to check the user's information?
```Linux
id username
```
#### Check the information of _root_
```Linux
id root
```
> [!TIP]
> When user do not exists, return: user do not exists

## Switch User
- When you are in Linux, if your user permissions are insufficient, you can use _su - username_ to switch to a user with higher permission, root, for instance.

```Linux
su - username
```

#### example
Create a user Jelly, give it a password, then check his information, then switch to his account

```Linux
useradd Jelly
passwd Jelly

id Jelly
su Jelly
```

- When you switch accounts from a higher class to a lower one, you don't need to write the password conversely, password is nesseary
- When you need to return to the original user, use _exit/logout_
